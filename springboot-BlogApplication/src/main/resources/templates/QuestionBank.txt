üíª Core Java
1. What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java?
== compares object references (memory addresses).

.equals() compares object content (defined by the class).

Example:

java
String a = new String("hello");
String b = new String("hello");
System.out.println(a == b);      // false
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true
2. What is a functional interface?
An interface with exactly one abstract method.

Used in lambda expressions.

Example:

java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunc {
    void execute();
}
üß© OOP Concepts
3. What is polymorphism in Java?
Ability of an object to take many forms.

Achieved via method overriding and method overloading.

Example:

java
class Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}
4. Difference between abstract class and interface?
Feature	Abstract Class	Interface
Methods	Can have both	Only abstract (until Java 8)
Multiple Inheritance	Not supported	Supported
Fields	Can have fields	Only constants
üåê Spring Boot
5. What is Spring Boot and why is it used?
Spring Boot simplifies Spring app development by:

Auto-configuring beans

Embedded servers (Tomcat)

No XML configuration

It helps build standalone, production-ready applications quickly.

6. What is dependency injection?
A design pattern where objects are provided their dependencies.

Spring uses annotations like @Autowired to inject beans.

üóÑÔ∏è JPA / Hibernate
7. What is the difference between JPA and Hibernate?
JPA is a specification.

Hibernate is an implementation of JPA.

JPA provides annotations like @Entity, @Id, @OneToMany.

8. How do you define a one-to-many relationship in JPA?
java
@Entity
class Department {
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "department")
    List<Employee> employees;
}

@Entity
class Employee {
    @ManyToOne
    Department department;
}
üîå REST APIs
9. What is REST and what are its key principles?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

Principles:

Statelessness

Resource-based URLs

Use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

Standard status codes

10. How do you handle exceptions in Spring Boot REST APIs?
Use @ControllerAdvice and @ExceptionHandler:

java
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
    }
}
‚öôÔ∏è System Design Basics
11. How would you design a URL shortening service?
Components:

API to accept long URL and return short code

Database to store mappings

Redirect logic for short URL

Use hashing or base62 encoding for short codes.

12. What is caching and where would you use it?
Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory.

Improves performance and reduces DB load.

Use cases: product catalog, user sessions, API responses.

üß™ Testing
13. What is unit testing and which frameworks do you use?
Unit testing checks individual components.

Use JUnit for writing tests and Mockito for mocking dependencies.

14. How do you mock a service in a test?
java
@Mock
UserService userService;

@InjectMocks
UserController userController;
Would you like me to format this into a printable guide or expand it with advanced questions for senior roles?









üîß Scenario 1: API Performance Issue
‚ùì Your REST API is taking too long to respond. How would you troubleshoot and optimize it?
‚úÖ Answer:
Step 1: Profile the API

Use tools like Spring Actuator, logs, or APM tools (e.g., New Relic) to identify bottlenecks.

Step 2: Check Database Queries

Look for N+1 query problems or missing indexes.

Optimize queries or use pagination.

Step 3: Add Caching

Use Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data.

Step 4: Reduce Payload

Avoid sending unnecessary fields in the response.

Step 5: Asynchronous Processing

Use @Async or message queues for non-critical tasks.

üß© Scenario 2: Handling Concurrent Updates
‚ùì Two users try to update the same record simultaneously. How do you prevent data inconsistency?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use Optimistic Locking with JPA:

java
@Version
private int version;
This adds a version column to the entity. If two updates happen, the second one will fail if the version has changed.

Alternatively, use Pessimistic Locking if data integrity is critical:

java
@Lock(LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)
üîê Scenario 3: Securing an API
‚ùì You need to secure an endpoint so only authenticated users can access it. How would you do that in Spring Boot?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use Spring Security:

Add dependency: spring-boot-starter-security

Configure security:

java
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
          .authorizeRequests()
          .antMatchers("/api/secure/**").authenticated()
          .and()
          .httpBasic();
    }
}
For token-based auth, use JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

üóÑÔ∏è Scenario 4: Database Migration
‚ùì You need to add a new column to a live production database. How do you handle this safely?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use a migration tool like Flyway or Liquibase.

Steps:

Create a migration script: V2__add_column.sql

Test in staging environment.

Deploy during low-traffic hours.

Ensure backward compatibility in code (e.g., handle nulls).

üîÑ Scenario 5: Retry Logic for External API
‚ùì Your service calls an external API that occasionally fails. How do you implement retry logic?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use Spring Retry:

java
@Retryable(
  value = { RemoteServiceException.class },
  maxAttempts = 3,
  backoff = @Backoff(delay = 2000)
)
public String callExternalApi() {
    // logic
}
Alternatively, use Resilience4j for more advanced features like circuit breakers and rate limiting.

üì¶ Scenario 6: File Upload Handling
‚ùì How would you implement a secure file upload endpoint in Spring Boot?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use MultipartFile in controller:

java
@PostMapping("/upload")
public ResponseEntity<?> uploadFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
    // validate and store
}
Security considerations:

Validate file type and size.

Store files outside the web root.

Rename files to avoid collisions.

Scan for malware if needed.

Would you like me to add more scenarios related to microservices, CI/CD, or real-time data processing?

Can you provide more scenario-based questions?
Absolutely! Here are more scenario-based interview questions and answers tailored for a Backend Java Developer with 2 years of experience, covering areas like microservices, error handling, deployment, logging, and scalability.

üßµ Scenario 7: Microservices Communication
‚ùì You have two microservices: Service A needs to call Service B. How would you implement this communication?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use REST API for synchronous communication:

Use RestTemplate or WebClient (preferred for reactive).

For resilience:

Add retry, timeout, and circuit breaker using Resilience4j.

For asynchronous communication:

Use message queues like Kafka or RabbitMQ.

Ensure authentication between services using JWT or API keys.

üß± Scenario 8: Breaking a Monolith
‚ùì Your team wants to break a monolithic app into microservices. What steps would you take?
‚úÖ Answer:
Identify bounded contexts: Split by business domains.

Extract services gradually: Start with least dependent modules.

Define APIs: Clear contracts between services.

Use shared libraries: For common utilities and models.

Implement service discovery: Use tools like Eureka or Consul.

Centralized logging and monitoring: Use ELK stack or Prometheus + Grafana.

üßº Scenario 9: Cleaning Up Stale Data
‚ùì You need to delete stale records from the database every night. How would you implement this?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use Spring Scheduler:

java
@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * * ?") // Runs at 2 AM daily
public void cleanStaleData() {
    // delete logic
}
Ensure:

Proper indexing for delete queries.

Logging and alerting on failures.

Transactional safety.

üìä Scenario 10: Logging Strategy
‚ùì How would you implement logging in a production-grade backend application?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use SLF4J with Logback or Log4j2.

Log levels:

INFO for business flow

DEBUG for dev diagnostics

ERROR for failures

Use MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) for tracing request IDs.

Centralize logs using ELK stack or Fluentd + CloudWatch.

üß† Scenario 11: Handling NullPointerException
‚ùì Your application throws a NullPointerException in production. How do you debug and prevent it?
‚úÖ Answer:
Debugging:

Check logs and stack trace.

Identify the object that‚Äôs null.

Prevention:

Use Optional where applicable.

Add null checks or use Objects.requireNonNull().

Write unit tests to cover edge cases.

üöÄ Scenario 12: Deployment Failure
‚ùì Your Spring Boot app fails to start after deployment. What steps do you take to resolve it?
‚úÖ Answer:
Check application logs for stack trace.

Validate:

Port conflicts

Missing environment variables

Database connectivity

Incorrect configuration files

Roll back to previous stable version if needed.

Use health checks and readiness probes in containerized environments.

üßÆ Scenario 13: High Load Handling
‚ùì Your API is experiencing high traffic. How do you ensure it scales effectively?
‚úÖ Answer:
Horizontal scaling: Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer.

Caching: Use Redis or in-memory cache for frequent reads.

Database optimization: Indexing, connection pooling.

Rate limiting: Prevent abuse using tools like Bucket4j.

Async processing: Offload heavy tasks to background jobs.

üß™ Scenario 14: Testing a Payment Flow
‚ùì You‚Äôre building a payment API. How do you test it safely?
‚úÖ Answer:
Use sandbox environments provided by payment gateways.

Mock external APIs using WireMock or Mockito.

Write integration tests for end-to-end flow.

Validate edge cases: failed payments, retries, duplicate transactions.
